#
# Example configuration for private node cluster
# This file should be copied to ~/.kaspa-resolver/cluster.toml
# and edited to match the actual configuration of the cluster.
#
# For testing, run the resolver with the following command:
# cargo run --release -- --trace --verbose --config-file=examples/local.toml --auto-update 
#
# To run under kHOST deployment, copy this file to `~/.kaspa-resolver/local.toml`.
# Existence of `~/.kaspa-resolver/local.toml` will override any other configuration settings.
